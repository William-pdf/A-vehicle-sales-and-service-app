## Design
This application has 3 major categories Service, Sales, and inventory. The inventory was our starting point and contains a list of models, manafactureres and autos. These were used to create functionality for each of the following microservices. 

We used react to create the front end of the application. This was a challenging task for most of the time we worked on it. Completing the Django models was the fundamental challenge for the project. 

The app is a bootstrap application that was designed to be as simple as possible for the average user. There is no difficult language or harsh forms.


## Service microservice

Microservice to display service appointments, a list of said appointments with details including but not limited to (VIN, customer name, date, reason for service, etc.) services,  with an assigned technician on each of these features. 
This goes along with a service history which will show appointments for a specific vin and all the previous customer/vehicle data.
The front end is maintained with React.

## Sales microservice
The sales microservice consists of serveral pages and lists that can track sales of autos, based on the salesman, price, and assigned automobile. Along with keeping track of the history of the sales, we keep track of perspetive customers. Automobiles and each salesperson we have had. 

Each of these forms function on a react based front end integrated with django and javascript.
