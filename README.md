## Design
We used react to create the front end of the application. This was a challenging task for most of the time we worked on it. Completing the Django models was the fundamental challenge for the project. 

The app is a bootstrap application that was designed to be as simple as possible for the average user. There is no difficult language or harsh forms.


## Service microservice

Microservice to display service appointments, a list of said appointments with details including but not limited to (VIN, customer name, date, reason for service, etc.) services,  with an assigned technician on each of these features. 
This goes along with a service history which will show appointments for a specific vin and all the previous customer/vehicle data.

## Sales microservice
